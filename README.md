## 🚀 Core Capabilities

### Agent Arsenal
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent is precision-tuned for specific operations
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate complex missions with multiple agents
- **Adaptive Workflows**: Dynamic agent selection based on mission parameters

### Workflow Patterns
- **Sequential Operations**: Chain agents for step-by-step execution
- **Parallel Deployments**: Run multiple agents simultaneously
- **Conditional Branching**: Smart routing based on outcomes
- **Error Recovery**: Built-in contingency protocols

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Templates**: Pre-configured operational environments
- **Tool Integrations**: Seamless connection to your existing arsenal
- **Security Protocols**: Built-in safety measures and access controls

### Command Operations
- **Advanced Tool Showcases**: Demonstration of Claude Code's full capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Complex parallel and sequential agent deployments
- **Automated Workflows**: Pre-built commands for common development scenarios

## 🎭 Featured Agents

- **code-reviewer**: Security and quality analysis specialist
- **test-runner**: Automated testing and validation operative
- **frontend-engineer**: UI/UX implementation expert
- **product-manager**: Strategic planning and coordination
- **security-reviewer**: Vulnerability assessment specialist
- **And more classified operatives...**

## 📡 Getting Started

### Mission Prerequisites
- Claude Code (claude.ai/code) access
- Basic understanding of agentic workflows
- Security clearance (just kidding, it's open source!)

### Deployment Instructions
1. Clone this classified repository
2. Review agent definitions in the `agents/` directory
3. Study workflow patterns in `workflows/`
4. Execute your first mission using the Task tool

### Example Operation
```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: code-reviewer
  description: Review critical security updates
  prompt: Analyze the authentication module for vulnerabilities
```

## 🔧 Contributing

New recruits welcome! When contributing:
1. Follow the established agent definition format
2. Document your workflows thoroughly
3. Test in isolated environments first
4. Submit via secure channels (pull requests)

## 📚 Documentation

Detailed operational manuals available in the `documentation/` directory:
- Agent Creation Guide
- Workflow Orchestration Patterns
- Best Practices & Conventions
- Troubleshooting Protocols
